# AI4APGovernance - Artificial Intelligence for Public Administration Governance

## Abstract
Based on Artificial Intelligence (AI), Natural Language Processing, Generative AI and Data Science techniques, the project aims to provide a digital interaction system with an interdisciplinary and citizen-centered perspective, as well as optimize administrative processes to promote and improve strategic governance in Public Administration (PA).  

The goal is to support digital transformation and automation processes, improving governmental operations, particularly in a municipal council, for the benefit of society and citizens.  

From a research perspective and real application in Public Administration, the grant's timing could not be more opportune. The world is on the cusp of a new era in PA, one that is **data-driven and AI-assisted**.

## Project Objectives
The project will deliver **two computational systems**:

1. **AI Platform for Strategic Governance**
   - A chatbot for citizens and administrative staff, available 24/7.  
   - Provides an automated conversation interface with virtual staff to support municipal service scenarios.  
   - Historical data will be analyzed with data science techniques, materialized in a **web/mobile dashboard** to:  
     - classify, forecast and pattern analysis  
     - support decision-making  
     - improve strategic governance  
     - implement guidelines and control indicators and risks  

2. **AI Email Add-On/Plugin for Process Optimization**
   - To be incorporated into email software for administrative services.  
   - Will **categorize, prioritize, summarize and propose responses** intelligently.  
   - Example: automatically suggesting a response to a citizen's email, improving response time and quality.

## Collaboration
A **city council (municipality) of the north of Portugal** is a collaborating institution, actively involved in:  
- Study, design, and development of the project  
- Local simulation and testing  
- Ensuring relevance and impact for PA entities  

Expected results: improved **strategic governance** and potential replication in other public administration entities.
